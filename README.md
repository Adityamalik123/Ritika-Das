<!--
**Ritika-Das/Ritika-Das** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:-->

- 🔭 I’m currently working on creating 3D models, simulations and digital circuits for viable future projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning (and looking up stuff on) how to give some of my favourite music a digital rendition.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on similar topics.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with new ideas related to my current repository stuff.
- 💬 Ask me about anything in my repositories.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can view my activity at https://www.linkedin.com/in/ritika-das-ece/, where I get to know an ounce more about topics I care for.
- 😄 Pronouns: ANY. Literally.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love learning languages in my free time so that when I go to sleep, I can dream of conversing with "foreign natives" about their professions like sandwich makers, farmers, decorators and even coders.
